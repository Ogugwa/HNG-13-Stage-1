            <h1>Hi, My name is Deborah but you can call me Debby.</h1>
            <p> A frontend developer based in Nigeria. I am the defination of persistence as I have been 
              learning programming for a while now learnt C++ in school but had no interest.
              I wrote my first code which was Python in 2022 but i fell when things got hard. 
            </p>
            <p>I picked myself up in 2023 and moved to Web development learning HTML,CSS and Javascript. Javscript seemed almost
              incomprehensible for me. But I have persisted though I cannot proudly say I have mastered Js but that is the main reason I am here at HNG
              to prove to  myself that I can do it.
